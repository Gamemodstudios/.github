## 🌟 Who We Are

Gamemodstudios is **not a traditional company** — we're a **collaborative group** of gamers, developers, and creators redefining what it means to build games. We operate more like a passionate friend group with a mission:
**To create affordable, open, and moddable games that empower players and creators alike.**

We believe in **creative freedom**, **accessible tooling**, and **a strong community-first approach** to game development and modding.

## 🎯 Our Vision

* 🆓 **Low-cost or free games** that prioritize accessibility over profit.
* 🔧 **Built-in mod support** and easy-to-use development tools.
* 🛠️ **Open ecosystems** that enable anyone to customize, remix, and build upon our work.
* 🤝 **Community-driven innovation**, where players and creators are on equal footing.

We're not here to gatekeep or monetize every asset — we're here to **co-create the future of gaming.**
